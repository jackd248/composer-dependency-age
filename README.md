A Composer plugin that analyzes the age of your project dependencies and provides neutral categorization to help you understand your dependency landscape. No risk assessment - just clear, objective information about when your dependencies were last released.

> [!warning]
> This package is in early development stage and may change significantly in the future. I am working steadily to release a stable version as soon as possible.

> [!note]
> Understanding the age of your dependencies is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase.
> While newer isn't always better, knowing when your dependencies were last updated helps you make informed decisions about maintenance, security planning, and technical debt management.
> This tool provides objective age categorization without making assumptions about what you should do - empowering you to prioritize updates based on your project's specific needs, risk tolerance and maintenance windows.

## ✨ Features

- **Neutral Age Analysis** - Categorizes dependencies as Current, Medium, or Old based on release dates
- **Multiple Output Formats** - CLI table, JSON for automation, GitHub-formatted for PRs
- **Flexible Filtering** - Analyze all dependencies or focus on direct ones only
- **Smart Caching** - Caches Packagist API responses with configurable TTL for better performance
- **CI/CD Ready** - Perfect for automated dependency auditing in your build pipelines
- **Highly Configurable** - Customize thresholds, ignore lists, and output preferences

## 🔥 Installation

```bash
composer require konradmichalik/composer-dependency-age --dev
```

## 📊 Usage

### Command
Run the command to fully analyze your dependencies:

```bash
composer dependency-age
```

### Automatic Analysis
The plugin automatically runs after `composer install` and `composer update` operations, providing immediate feedback on your dependency landscape.

```shell
$ composer install
...
Dependency age ~ // 21.9 years in total (9 months average per package). Use composer dependency-age for full details.
...
```

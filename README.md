A Composer plugin that analyzes the age of your project dependencies and provides neutral categorization to help you understand your dependency landscape. No risk assessment - just clear, objective information about when your dependencies were last released.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Neutral Age Analysis** - Categorizes dependencies as Current, Medium, or Old based on release dates
- **Multiple Output Formats** - CLI table, JSON for automation, GitHub-formatted for PRs
- **Flexible Filtering** - Analyze all dependencies or focus on direct ones only
- **Smart Caching** - Caches Packagist API responses with configurable TTL for better performance
- **CI/CD Ready** - Perfect for automated dependency auditing in your build pipelines
- **Highly Configurable** - Customize thresholds, ignore lists, and output preferences

## üöÄ Installation

Install the plugin globally or per project via Composer:

```bash
composer require konradmichalik/composer-dependency-age
```

The plugin integrates automatically with Composer and adds the `dependency-age` command.

## üìä Usage

### Basic Analysis
```bash
composer dependency-age
```

### Focus on Direct Dependencies
```bash
composer dependency-age --direct
```

### JSON Output for CI/CD
```bash
composer dependency-age --format json
```

### GitHub-Formatted Output
```bash
composer dependency-age --format github
```

## üìù Configuration

### Command Line Options

|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Current | ‚úÖ | ‚â§ 6 months | Recently released dependencies |
| Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚â§ 12 months | Moderately aged dependencies |
| Old | ‚ùó | > 12 months | Dependencies released over a year ago |
| Unknown | ‚ùì | - | Dependencies without release date information |

## üí° Output Formats

### CLI Table (Default)
Human-readable table with colors, symbols, and summary statistics. Perfect for manual review and development workflow.

### JSON Format
Machine-readable output ideal for:
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Custom reporting tools
- Automated dependency monitoring
- Data analysis workflows

### GitHub Format
Markdown-optimized output designed for:
- Pull request comments
- Issue tracking
- GitHub Actions integration
- Team communication

## üîß Integration

### Automatic Analysis
The plugin automatically runs after `composer install` and `composer update` operations, providing immediate feedback on your dependency landscape.

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Check dependency ages in CI
composer dependency-age --format json > dependency-report.json

# Focus on direct dependencies only
composer dependency-age --direct --no-colors
```

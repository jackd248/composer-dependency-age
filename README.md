A Composer plugin that analyzes the age of your project dependencies and provides neutral categorization to help you understand your dependency landscape. No risk assessment - just clear, objective information about when your dependencies were last released.

> [!warning]
> This package is in early development stage and may change significantly in the future. I am working steadily to release a stable version as soon as possible.

> [!note]
> Understanding the age of your dependencies is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase.
> While newer isn't always better, knowing when your dependencies were last updated helps you make informed decisions about maintenance, security planning, and technical debt management.
> This tool provides objective age categorization without making assumptions about what you should do - empowering you to prioritize updates based on your project's specific needs, risk tolerance and maintenance windows.

</div>

A Composer plugin that analyzes the age of your project dependencies and provides neutral categorization to help you understand your dependency landscape. No risk assessment - just clear, objective information about when your dependencies were last released.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Neutral Age Analysis** - Categorizes dependencies as Current, Medium, or Old based on release dates
- **Multiple Output Formats** - CLI table, JSON for automation, GitHub-formatted for PRs
- **Flexible Filtering** - Analyze all dependencies or focus on direct ones only
- **Smart Caching** - Caches Packagist API responses with configurable TTL for better performance
- **CI/CD Ready** - Perfect for automated dependency auditing in your build pipelines
- **Highly Configurable** - Customize thresholds, ignore lists, and output preferences

## üî• Installation

```bash
composer require konradmichalik/composer-dependency-age --dev
```

## üìä Usage

### Command
```bash
composer dependency-age
```

### Automatic Analysis
The plugin automatically runs after `composer install` and `composer update` operations, providing immediate feedback on your dependency landscape.

```shell
$ composer install
...
Dependency age ~ // 21.9 years in total (9 months average per package). Use composer dependency-age for full details.
...
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--format` | Output format: cli, json, github | cli |

### Configuration via composer.json

```json
{
  "extra": {
    "dependency-age": {
      "thresholds": {
        "current": 0.5,
        "medium": 1.0,
        "old": 2.0

      "include_dev": false,
      "cache_ttl": 86400,
      "event_integration": true,
      "event_operations": ["install", "update"],
      "event_analysis_limit": 10
    }

**To disable composer hooks entirely:**
```json
{
  "extra": {
    "dependency-age": {
      "event_integration": false
    }
  }
}
```

**To run analysis only after install (not update):**
```json
{
  "extra": {
    "dependency-age": {
      "event_operations": ["install"]
    }
  }
}
```
